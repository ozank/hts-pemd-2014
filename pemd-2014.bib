At present, the superconducting generators are not expected to have an impact on the onshore turbines due to the limited size growth.
        
the interest in wind turbine application has increased during the last five years [24â€“27]
        
A UK based project on HTS wind energy systems was also initiated in 2005 with Converteam as project leaders and with the goal to make a market entry of a 8 MW and 12 rpm direct drive generator by 2011 [25]. In 2007 American Superconductor initiated a joint research venture with TECO-Westinghouse with the goal to develop a 10 MW and 11 rpm direct drive generator [27].
        
Various wind turbine data is given !
        
COMSOL is used for 2D FEA analysis
        
HTS Tape Length estimations in the order of 1450 km for this paper, 200 km target for American Superconductor
        
The Converteam/Zenergy group has just recently published a discussion of the benefits of the superconducting drive train and estimated that it will bemore cost effective than permanent magnet direct drives above 5MW[32].

abstract = {In this study a new claw-pole type trans- verse flux superconducting generator topology is pre- sented. The machine has a stationary superconducting field winding which eliminates electrical brushes and cryocouplers. The machine is specifically designed for low-speed high torque applications such as large off- shore wind turbines. The proposed machine is robust and has a modular structure. A 30 kW, 100 rpm prototype is planned to be man- ufactured to prove the concept. MgB2, YBCO, BSSCO wires are compared in terms of wire length, operating temperature and cost. The magnetic flux penetrating into superconducting wire has been simulated using 3D FEA software. Moreover, mechanical loads is estimated and the deflections in the structure is analysed.

abstract = {For offshore wind energy, there is a trend toward larger wind turbines. The increased mass of a power-takeoff system increases the installation cost of the turbine. Direct-drive superconducting generators have the potential to reduce the installation cost of wind turbines. For a successful entry to the off- shore-wind-energy market, a high-temperature superconducting generator should be as reliable as conventional generators. It is proposed that a stationary superconducting direct-current-field winding may increase the reliability of the generator. An axial-flux homopolar generator topology is proposed to be used in low-speed high-torque applications. The topology is modified by using two superconducting field windings to obtain a bipolar flux-density distribution for higher power density. Different core types and dimensions were examined to find the most suitable design, and a conceptual design of a 6-MW 12-r/min generator is presented.},
