\section*{Abstract}
Larger offshore wind turbines help to reduce the installation and maintenance cost per unit energy generated. However, tower-head mass becomes a real challenge with conventional power take-off systems as the power rating is increased. Direct-drive superconducting generators are proposed to overcome this issue. There are many 10 MW, 10 rpm superconducting generator designs, most of which having the same topology: a synchronous machine with a conventional copper armature winding and a superconducting rotor. However, this design may not be the most suitable topology for an offshore wind turbine application, where the O&M costs are very high. 
The rotating superconducting field windings in this type of machines require rotating transfer couplings to transfer the cooling gas and they also need brushes or brushless exciters, which remains as the single point of failure in the machine, decreasing the overall reliability. Furthermore, in these designs the electromagnetic forces act on the superconducting windings, which makes the structural and thermal design challenging.
The cost of the power take-off system for a wind turbine is also very critical, and the cost of a superconducting machine is usually dominated by the cost of superconducting tape. In the common designs, the superconducting tape requirement is usually in the order of hundreds of kilometres because of two main factors: the superconducting field winding can be air-cored, which increases the MMF requirements. Secondly, even if the machine is iron-cored, the main flux path has to cross the insulation layers, vacuum and cryostat walls, which increases the equivalent magnetic gap, even if the mechanical gap is kept minimum.
In this paper, a novel transverse flux superconducting machine topology that can overcome these issues will be presented. The machine has stationary superconducting field windings and a modular claw-pole rotor. The field winding is also modular and can be placed in independent cryostat sections. Thus, even in one of the cryostat section fails machine, the machine can still operate at partial load until the maintenance. Having smaller cryostat sections also have logistics advantages such as easy installation/ transportation, and using on-site crane for any replacements. Another advantage of the topology is the minimum superconducting wire requirement. A 10 MW design is estimated to use just 15 km of MgB2 wire at 30 K. This is due to iron-cored structure and because main flux path does not cross through the cryostat (i.e. magnetic gap equals to the mechanical gap) which minimizes the required MMF.
A small linear prototype with copper winding is manufactured to prove the concept and it is planned to replace the copper winding with a high-temperature superconducting winding and repeat the tests with a proper superconducting coil at 30 K. The results will be presented in the full paper.

\section{Introduction}

Many superconducting machines have been designed and manufactured since the early days of superconductivity. For example, General Electric developed a 20 MW low-temperature superconducting generator in 1981 (see Fig. \ref{GE_LTS_machine}). There are a few other projects as listed in \cite{Barnes2005}, however, most of them just remained as prototypes due to cooling issues and high cost.

One of the practical applications of the superconducting machines is ship propulsion motors. Superconducting propulsion motors offer reduced mass and volume, which increases the cargo capacity or extends the range of the ship. An example of such a motor is presented in Fig. \ref{converteam_5MW}, which is manufactured by Converteam and AMSC in 2011. It can be seen from the figure that the HTS motor is twice as powerful as the load motor, it is much smaller. A 36.5 MW, 120 rpm superconducting machine was also manufactured, which weights just 75 tonnes \citep{Gamble2011}.

The machines presented in the previous paragraph and many others have the same topology: synchronous motor with superconducting rotor. Copper windings are usually used in the armature because of AC losses in a superconducting coil limits the current density. 


Average size of onshore wind turbines are limited in 3--3.5~MW range due to transportation limitations and wind speeds. However, there is a trends towards larger wind turbines for offshore installations. This trend can be seen in Fig. \ref{offshore-turbine-size}, which shows the turbine size increased from 2 MW to 6 MW in ten years. Larger wind turbines reduces the installation and maintenance cost per MW, benefit from higher wind speeds. In \cite{Abrahamsen2010}, it is stated that 10 MW offshore wind turbines are desirable in 2020. This is a ambitious challenge to achieve with the existing power take-off(PTO) systems. The geared systems, which is the most common PTO system, have some reliability issues and the mass of the gearbox increases enormously with increasing torque requirements. Direct-drive permanent magnet generators (DDPMG) also suffer from high mass problem and the diameter of these machines are quite large. 

Superconducting machines are proposed to minimize the mass of the PTO system. The reduction of the tower head-mass will also help to reduce cost of installation and structural components costs (e.g. tower, foundation).

\section{A Review of Superconducting Machines}

bi onceki sectiondan devam

The synchronous generator with a superconducting rotor introduces many problems. Some of these can be listed as:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Rotating TransNo rotating transfer coupler, more robust and cheaper cooling system.
  \item No electrical brushes or complex excitation systems.
  \item No centrifugal forces and transient torques that can damage the superconducting material.
  \item Simpler winding support.
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
  \item[Rotating Transfer Coupler:] As the superconducting coil is in the rotor a coupler is required to transfer the coolant from cryocoolers to the rotor structure. This coupler introduces reliability issues and requires regular maintenance. Furthermore, it is the single point of failure for the all system. There are some designs to simplify or remove this coupler. For example AMSC plans to put the cold heads in the rotor for their 10 MW, 10 rpm generator design \cite{amsc_presentation}. General Electric plans to eliminate the cryocoupler by using a rotating armature structure \cite{Stautner2012}. However, the design still requires high current electrical brushes, which require regular maintenance.
